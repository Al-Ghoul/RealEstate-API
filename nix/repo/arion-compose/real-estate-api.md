# Real Estate API

We use nix to build, containerize the project and its related services, and Arion to declare our deployments of them services.

Images:

1. real-estate-api - The Real Estate API.
1. real-estate-postgres-service - Postgres service that hosts the database.
1. real-estate-redis-service - Redis service that hosts the cache.

the aforementioned images are built from the source code and create the following services:

1. RealEstate-API - contains the Express backendâ€”API
2. RealEstate-Postgres - contains the Postgres database service
3. RealEstate-Redis - contains the Redis cache service

## Configuration

The following environment variables are *required* for the Real Estate API to run:
